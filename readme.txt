# ABOUT
This program (NameSayer) was created by Angela Huang (ahua186) and Frank Wang Ma (fwan175).

The target users are students. The software is designed for students to practice the names of their classmates.

# How To Use
There should be a folder called "NameSayer". This is where the program is located. This folder should include three items:
a folder called "input", "NameSayer.jar" and "run.sh".

To add recordings to the database, place the .wav audio files into the "input" folder. Before you run the program 
for the first time, this folder should include audio files already. After you run the program, these audio files
will automatically be moved elsewhere.

To run the program, open a command window in the same place as "NameSayer.jar". 
Type "./run.sh" (without quotes) in the command line.

For more information, refer to the user manual.
